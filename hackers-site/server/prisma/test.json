Note that the original model was trained on 512x512 and may lead to repetition especially if you try to increase both dimensions (this is mentioned in the SD readme) so just run with one dimension increased.<p>For example try the following example:<p>python scripts&#x2F;txt2img.py --prompt &quot;a person gardening, by claude monet&quot; --ddim_steps 50 --seed 12000 --scale 9 --n_iter=1 --n_samples=1 --H=512 --W=1024 --skip_grid<p>I confirmed that if I run that command with the original attention.py, it fails due to lack of memory. With the new attention.py, it succeeds.<p>That said, this still uses 13GB of ram on my system.<p>I suppose you can check out the full repo with the updated code, which seems to have other changes, if you want to give that a try.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;neonsecret&#x2F;stable-diffusion&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;neonsecret&#x2F;stable-diffusion&#x2F;</a><p>I have already been using the original SD repo so I found benefit by just changing attention.py",

    "content": "<p>Hi all,\nI&#x27;m looking to get into niche dashboards for my special interest (cycling adjacent and adrenaline junkie). This world has tons of users, but no &#x27;whales&#x27;.<p>I simply want to host a dashboard and allow people to access it for 10-15 dollars a month while making a bit of meat for myself (to allow full-time work on the project). I considered PowerBI, but learnt that the user account license would run 10 dollars a pop, per month. So say I scale to 10k users, almost all of my money would be going straight to the MS.<p>What are the best modern ways to do this? Looking around, it seems I can use an Azure SQL server or Amazon dynamoDB to host the database and get good reliability and concurrency somewhat cheaply. How can I do the same with the dashboard itself? (if I was doing time series data, an Amazon managed Grafana looks like a winner, but I&#x27;m doing a simple dashboard with little time series data).<p>Thanks!",

    "content": "<p>As part of an embeddable video player I&#x27;m starting to build, I need to have some way of keeping track of viewer behavior.<p>The easy way is to integrate something like Mux (YC Winter 2016). The even easier way is to just use an existing player like video js. But I want to start off by building my own solution.<p>I have the basic player working (still some race conditions to be resolved), so now I am starting to look at tracking viewing behavior. I need to know things like timestamp till which a viewer has watched the video, at what timestamps they paused&#x2F;played&#x2F;forwarded it, when they wanted to seek to an earlier time and rewatch a part of it, etc. etc.<p>Say I start a timer when the viewer presses play. Then for each (milli)second I can check the timestamp of the video - this will let me track if some parts of the video were replayed or fast forwarded. Whenever the viewer presses play&#x2F;pause&#x2F;forward, I record the event.  I send this info to the server every 1 or 2 or 5 seconds and do the analytics.<p>Since I haven&#x27;t done this sort of thing before, I would love to have some inputs on if this ^ is the right approach.<p>Does it make sense to treat this data as a timeseries data? If not (even if it is), what else is a good way to organize this data?<p>I assume something like Cassandra (which I haven&#x27;t used much) is much better suited for this than Postgres (which I am comfortable with). Is this right?",

It will be integrated with the input form on the home page.\n2.  An API that receives HTML content to make a proper email and sends it to all the subscribers.

The majority is does not care that no iPhones are being officially imported anyway. Coca Cola is still there, KFC is still there, same as tons of other brands.<p>- USA: absolute winner. Making trillions on overprices LNG. Finally the investments in the infrastructure will pay off. Further, billions and billions of dollars in arm sales to the &quot;European partners&quot;. Also the provocation of China has led to amazing sales deals in Taiwan - and that&#x27;s just the beginning. Japan and Korea (with Moon, the Korean Trump) have announced to purchase more US weapons.<p>- Europe: the big loser. Unable to end the war. Unable to influence Ukraine. Unable to respond to Russia. Europe has to buy American overpriced LNG to survive. Tons of companies are shutting down already, here in Germany one bad news after the other hits the news. People stand up against idealistic value politics. Gas bills explode, electricity bills explode, production goes down. The governments have NO long or even mid-term plans, all politics is just for the &quot;now&quot;. The voters feel cheated, the common man starts to distrust the state.<p>So. Quo bono from the Ukraine war? Quo bono from the Taiwan conflict?",
